# Appium Finding My Birthday Test #
Used Appium to practice with the IOS Calendar app. When you change the birth date data,
it will scroll up automatically. This is the first project in that I 
used Appium and XCUITest driver with IOS, so I gained knowledge about the testing methods.

### How to work ###
open the FindingDateTest.java, and change the date of the birthday.
Also have to change udid, platformVersion of the simulator or real device.

### Demo ###
