# Appium Finding My Birthday Test #
Used Appium to practice with IOS Calendar app. When you change the data of birth date,
it will scroll up automatically. This is my first project that I 
used Appium, and XCUITest driver with IOS, so I gain the knowledge about the testing methods more.

### How to work ###
open the FindingDateTest.java, and change the date of the birthday.
Also have to change udid, platformVersion of the simulator or real device.
